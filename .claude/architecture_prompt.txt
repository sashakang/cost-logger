Analyze this Android app implementation plan for architectural concerns:

## Plan to Review:
[See .claude/plan_review.md]

## Evaluation Criteria:

1. **Over-Engineering Detection**
   - Are there unnecessary abstraction layers proposed?
   - Could any proposed interfaces be replaced with concrete implementations?
   - Are there planned classes that will only have one implementation?

2. **Pattern Appropriateness**
   - Is the proposed architecture (MVVM/MVI/MVP) appropriate for the feature scope?
   - Are UseCase classes justified, or could logic live in ViewModel?
   - Is the Repository pattern needed, or is direct data access simpler?

3. **Complexity vs Value**
   - Does each proposed layer add testability or maintainability value?
   - Could the same goal be achieved with fewer components?
   - Are there proposed abstractions solving hypothetical future problems?

4. **Android-Specific Considerations**
   - Are lifecycle-aware components used appropriately (not over-used)?
   - Is dependency injection setup proportional to app complexity?
   - Are Compose vs View decisions justified?

## Current Context:
- Existing MainActivity already has Activity-level business logic
- No ViewModels currently exist in the app
- App uses direct database access throughout
- Similar patterns used for notification rescanning

## Output Format:
- APPROVE: Plan is appropriately scoped
- SIMPLIFY: List specific reductions with rationale
- REJECT: Fundamental over-engineering concerns

Provide specific, actionable feedback.
