Analyze this Android app implementation plan for technical feasibility and best practices:

## Plan to Review:
[See .claude/plan_review.md]

## Evaluation Criteria:

1. **Technical Feasibility**
   - Are the proposed APIs/libraries compatible with target SDK versions?
   - Are there any deprecated approaches being planned?
   - Will the architecture work with Jetpack Compose / View system as specified?

2. **Kotlin Best Practices**
   - Can proposed classes leverage data classes, sealed classes, or value classes?
   - Are coroutines/Flow used appropriately for async operations?
   - Could extension functions simplify the proposed design?

3. **Android Platform Alignment**
   - Does the plan handle configuration changes correctly?
   - Is lifecycle management properly considered?
   - Are permissions, background work, and storage handled per current guidelines?

4. **Implementation Complexity**
   - Estimate LOC for each component
   - Identify potential integration challenges
   - Flag any areas requiring significant boilerplate

5. **Testing Strategy**
   - Is the proposed structure testable?
   - What test types are needed (unit, instrumented, UI)?
   - Are there any untestable patterns proposed?

## Current Context:
- App uses Jetpack Compose
- Room database with DAO pattern
- WorkManager for background tasks
- No existing ViewModels
- Direct Flow observation in Composables

## Specific Concerns:
1. Combining two Flow observations (notification + transaction counts) in Composable
2. WorkManager scheduling from UI layer
3. PackageManager access for app name resolution
4. Transaction submission logic in Composable
5. AppPreferences singleton usage

## Output Format:
- APPROVE: Plan is technically sound
- REVISE: List specific technical concerns with alternatives
- REJECT: Critical technical issues that block implementation

Provide Kotlin/Android-specific recommendations.
